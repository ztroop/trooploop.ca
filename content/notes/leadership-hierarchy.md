I worked for a company in the past that had a very strict sense of leadership hierarchy. Before we dig into that, let's get some context first.

## Background Context

I was in a computer security role, but often given programming tasks to complete. At the time, I thought it was a bit odd that my output was intentionally hushed from meetings. 🙊🙈

✨ A note for the reader. ✨ If you're ever working on tasks that are strategically obscured or omitted from other departments. It should raise a big ol' red flag.

## Conversation

Fast forward. One day in the lunch room, I asked the VP of Engineering if he knew who I could speak to about the "Software XYZ" API. It was a pleasant interaction and he could tell I was very interested in software development practices. Robert Martin's Clean Code was enthusiastically discussed in the process.

A day later I was called into a tiny meeting room with my managers.

- **Manager**: 😐 We know you've been talking to VP of Engineering.
- **Me**: 😊 Yeah! I asked in passing if he knew who I could talk to get more information about 'Software XYZ'.
- **Manager**: 🙁 You can't do that. There's a hierarchy that needs to be followed and you're not going through the right channels.

## Political Silos

There's some nuance here. It was considered _taboo_ to discuss software development if you were not "in" the software development department. The reason was political siloing and I will save you from that conversation for now.

## Conclusion

If I had a question around how something worked in our software, I would have to play a game of broken telephone to get an answer.

After this meeting, I thought this was a "_normal_" company procedure. Spoiler, it's not. A "_closed door_" policy only encourages a toxic work environment.
