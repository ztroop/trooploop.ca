        <p>I worked for a company in the past that had a very strict leadership hierarchy. Before we dig into that, let's get some context first.</p>
<h2 id="background-context">Background Context</h2>
<p>I was in a computer security role, but often given programming tasks to complete. At the time, I thought it was a bit odd that my output was intentionally hushed from meetings. üôäüôà</p>
<p>‚ú® A note for the reader. ‚ú® If you're ever working on tasks that are strategically obscured or omitted from other departments. That should raise a big ol' red flag.</p>
<h2 id="conversation">Conversation</h2>
<p>Fast forward, one day in the lunch room, I asked the VP of Engineering if he knew who I could speak to about the &quot;Software XYZ&quot; API. It was a pleasant interaction and he could tell I was very interested in software development practices. Robert Martin's Clean Code was enthusiastically discussed in the process.</p>
<p>A day later I was called into a tiny meeting room with my managers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manager</strong>: üòê We know you've been talking to VP of Engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Me</strong>: üòä Yeah! I asked in passing if he knew who I could talk to get more information about 'Software XYZ'.</li>
<li><strong>Manager</strong>: üôÅ You can't do that. There's a hierarchy that needs to be followed and you're not going through the right channels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="political-silos">Political Silos</h2>
<p>There's some nuance here. It was considered <em>taboo</em> to discuss software development if you were not &quot;in&quot; the software development department. The reason was political siloing and I will save you from that conversation for now.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I had a question around how something worked in our software, I would have to play a game of broken telephone to get an answer.</p>
<p>After this meeting, I thought this was a &quot;<em>normal</em>&quot; company procedure. Spoiler, it's not. A &quot;<em>closed door</em>&quot; policy only encourages a toxic work environment.</p>
