        <p>Hello there! This is an evolving piece around a rather large topic. Stay tuned for updates. ðŸ“»</p>
<h2 id="the-mantra">The Mantra</h2>
<p>My mantra was &quot;Do More&quot;. It's a quote by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">Casey Neistat</a>. This was the phrase in my head to remind me I should be productive.</p>
<p><img src="images/do_more.jpg" alt="Do More" /></p>
<p>In retrospect, I misunderstood the meaning. I believe I used this to justify my overworking tendencies. Instead, &quot;Do More&quot; should be a reminder to push beyond your comfort bubble and challenge yourself.</p>
<h2 id="loyalty-honour">Loyalty &amp; Honour</h2>
<p>In a previous job, I was working long hours. I would work 8:00AM to 10:00PM most days. The pay was mediocre and the work itself was mundane. In the end of the day, I wore it like a badge of honour.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;At least I'm loyal to the job.&quot;, I told myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>When my grandfather passed away, I realized that the work wasn't as important as I initially made it out to be.</p>
<p>Work will carry on with or without you. If you're not there, someone else will replace you. Your time with your family is precious and finite.</p>
<h2 id="glamorizing-overworking">Glamorizing Overworking</h2>
<p>When I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/KatyLeeson">@KatyLeeson</a>'s post on overworking, I knew I had to write this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We NEED to stop glamorizing overworking. The absence of sleep, good diet, exercise, relaxation, and time with friends and family isn't something to be applauded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Katy and I share similar sentiments. It's important to note that the employer may also encourage or incentivize overworking habits.</p>
<p>Here's a fictitious example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We would like to acknowledge the heroes that worked day and night over the Christmas holidays to resolve <code>issue X</code>. Thank you Alice and Bob for stepping up and putting in all your hard work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the technical issue, there's another problem. A lack of robustness allowed this scenario to happen as it did. A possible solution could have involved disabling the problematic feature temporarily while your staff is taking time off.</p>
<p>In the <em>acknowledgement</em>, the staff that sacrificed their time were labelled as &quot;Heroes&quot;. They &quot;Stepped Up&quot;.</p>
<p>This is dangerous for two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Encourages others to become &quot;Heroes&quot; as well. It <em>sounds</em> positive.</li>
<li>Promotes the idea that only employees that sacrifice their time and well-being will be acknowledged for their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone has different commitments in life. Married, kids, health issues and more. It's not okay to assume everyone time to sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id="burning-out">Burning Out</h2>
<p>I've burned out in the past. A couple of times. Despite all the reading and reflecting, it will probably happen again. Heck, even the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie6sSZQkUTM">Healthy Software Developer</a> is taking a hiatus. No one is immune to it.</p>
<p>You matter. Take care of yourself.</p>
